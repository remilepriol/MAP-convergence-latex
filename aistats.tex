\begin{abstract}
We consider the problem of upper bounding the expected sub-optimality of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), or a conjugate maximum a posteriori (MAP) for an exponential family. 
Surprisingly, we found no general solution to this problem in the literature. 
In particular, current theories do not hold for a Gaussian, or in the very interesting few samples regime.
After exhibiting various facets of the problem, we show the MAP can be interpreted as the result of Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD), 
yet it falls out of scope for modern analysis.
We believe solving this very fundamental problem may bring progress to both the statistics and optimization communities.
\end{abstract}

%In particular, no rates hold in the few samples regime  -- e.g. after seeing 5 samples from a gaussian, we do not know how many bits away from the true distribution we should expect our model to be.
%No rates hold either when the loss is ill-behaved : infinite domain, not smooth, not self-concordant


\section{Motivation}

We kind of know how to do optimization 
on smooth, strongly convex functions 
when there is some bound on the stochasticity,
for example in the form of a bounded variance, 
say for the problem 
\begin{equation}
\min_\theta f(\theta) 
\end{equation}
with access to stochastic gradients 
$g(\theta)$ such that 
\begin{equation}
	\expect{\norm{g(\theta) - \nabla f(\theta)}^2} \leq \sigma^2.
\end{equation}
Estimating the mean of Gaussian noise is a special case of this problem class, using 
$f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\norm{\theta - \mu}^2$ and $g(\theta) \sim \cN(- \mu, \sigma^2)$.
SGD with a decreasing step-size coincides with the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), 
and attains the $1/t$ convergence rate.

But our understanding of stochastic optimization lacks in other domains. 
A generalization of the above problem, at the intersection of optimization and statistics, 
is the problem of minimizing 
\begin{equation}
	f(\theta) = \expect[x \sim p(x\cond\theta_*)]{-\log p(x\cond\theta_*)},
\end{equation}
When $p(x\cond\theta)$ is an exponential family distribution,
$-\log p(x\cond\theta) = A(\theta) - \lin{t(x), \theta}$ (omitting the reference distribution).
Here, $A$ is the log-partition function, a Legendre function that we assume can be minimized in closed form.
The Gaussian example is the special case $A(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\norm{\theta}^2$.

There are algorithms for this setting, for example the MLE -- the (online) maximum likelihood after seeing $t$ samples -- or adding regularization, the MAP -- the maximum a posteriori.
As we will prove,\footnote{\fdk{I don't know any prior reference for this exact statement, but I'm not sure it's safe to claim this as a ``proof'' as if it was a new statement}} the MAP can be interpreted as online mirror descent with decreasing step-sizes.
Despite recent advances in this field, our convergence rates are still lacking; they are either asymptotic, cover only special cases or require having seen many ($n \gg d$) samples.

We do not have a solution. The goal of this paper
is to bring this issue to the attention of the community working at the intersection of machine learning, optimization and statistics,
in the hope that we can make progress on this question;
Can we build algorithms for stochastic estimation 
when the objective function is not (close to) quadratic
and the noise is not Gaussian?

We are aware that \emph{a} solution to this problem would be the maximum likelihood estimate for which there is a wealth of asymptotic and large sample results \citep{van2000asymptotic,ostrovskii2021finite}. %TODO complete 
However, none of the theory we found could address for instance the case of a Gaussian with unknown mean and variance $\cN(\mu,\sigma^2)$, hence our contributions. 
%TODO kind of redundant "problem - question - problem" paragraphs, not disentangling stats and optim. To improve

\paragraph{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We provide insights on different facets of this problem : quadratic approximations ; bias variance decomposition; and a detailed analysis of the Gaussian variance estimation problem.
	\item We show the connections between the optimization and statistical estimation view of the problem and discuss where current theories fail to fully capture the problem.
\end{itemize}

The statistics and optimization perspective are so tightly linked in this problem, that we believe progress from one field would help the other one. 
Progress from statistics could bring forward research in non-euclidean optimization, or the optimization of barrier losses, for instance helping in the development of accelerated methods.
On the other hand, optimization can become  a more versatile and general tool for statisticians. % handwavy and shady af.


% Then; 
% - description of the setting
% - statistical solutions (asymptotic, l1 or l2 error)
% - optimization solutions (online+bounded gradient, self-concordance, more recent relative smoothness results)
% - potential application of ideas that would solve this, beyond this problem (acceleration, causality?)
% - conclusion?


\section{Technical background}

Exponential Families are to statistics what linear models are to regression.
Many classical model are exponential families, and their convexity and modeling flexibility make them one of the most widely used statistical models. 
Here we review some of their properties. 
We point the reader towards \citet[Chapter 3]{wainwright2008graphical} for a full review.
The exponential family for data $X\in \cX$ with natural (or primal) parameter $\natp$  is specified by a sufficient statistic $T: \cX \rightarrow \real^d$ and a density with respect to a base measure $\nu(dx)$
\begin{equation}
	 p(X|\natp) = \exp( \natp^\top T(X) - \logpart(\natp)) \; ,
\end{equation}
Here $\logpart$ is the log-partition function -- i.e. the normalization term
\begin{align}
    \logpart(\natp) = \log \int e^{\natp^\top T(x)} \nu(dx) \; .
\end{align}
When explicit, we will write the random variable $T = T(X)$ for lightness.
For convenience, we focus on steep exponential families with $\logpart$ a convex function of Legendre type.
In particular, the set $\natp \in \Theta$ such that $\logpart(\natp) < \infty$ is open and convex.
This simple model encompasses both categorical distributions : $\cX = \{1, \dots, k\}, \nu$ uniform and $T(X)$  the one-hot encoding, and multivariate normal distributions $\cX=\real, \nu$ Lebesgues and $T(X)=(X, X^2)$. 

% TODO sort out relationships between : steep family, minimal statistics and Legendre type. What implies what ?

\paragraph{Duality}
The logpartition function $\logpart$ verifies the two following identities
\begin{align}
    \nabla\logpart(\natp) &=  \expect[p(T|\natp)]{T} =: \meanp \\
    \nabla^2 \logpart(\natp) &= \Cov_\natp[T] \geq 0
\end{align}
where $\meanp$ is called the mean (or dual) parameter.
From now on, we assume that the sufficient statistic $T$ is minimal 
-- e.g. its covariance is definite positive for all $\natp$ -- 
then the log-partition function $\logpart$ is strictly convex and its gradient $\nabla \logpart$ is a bijection between natural parameters $\natp$ and mean parameters $\mu$.
$\meanp$ lives in the open convex set $\cM$ equal to the relative interior of the convex hull of $T(\cX)$.
We will write interchangeably $\mu$ or  $\natp$ depending on the context, being aware that both represent the same distribution.
At this point it is useful to introduce the convex conjugate (a.k.a. Fenchel-Legendre transform) of the logpartition function
\begin{align}
	\conj(\mu) = \langle \mu, \natp \rangle - \logpart(\natp) \; .
\end{align}
which matches the common notion of \textit{entropy} in information theory.
The entropy is eating mean parameters, and its gradient is mapping back to natural parameters $\nabla\conj \circ \nabla\logpart(\natp) = \natp$ (cf Fig.~\ref{fig:duality}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{duality}
	\caption{The gradient of the log-partition function and its dual, $(\nabla \logpart, \nabla \conj)$, form a bijection between natural and mean parameters $\natp, \meanp$. Figure copied from \citet{kunstner2020homeomorphic}. % TODO make an original one.
	}
	\label{fig:duality}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Bregman Divergences}
A very useful object to keep in mind is the Bregman divergence induced by $\logpart$ between two parameters $\natp$ and $\natp_0$
\begin{align}
    \bregman (\natp ; \natp_0)
    & = \logpart(\natp) - \logpart(\natp_0) 
    - \langle \nabla \logpart(\natp_0)  , \natp - \natp_0 \rangle
\end{align}
with $\nabla \logpart(\natp_0) = \expect[\natp_0]{T(X)} =: \meanp_0$ the mean parameter associated to $\natp_0$. 
It is a non-symmetric measure of distance between parameters.
It is equal to the divergence of its convex conjugate with switched arguments
\begin{align}
	\bregman (\natp ; \natp_0)
    = \bregmanconj ( \meanp_0 ; \meanp) \; .
\end{align}

\paragraph{Conjugate Prior}
One conjugate prior \citep{agarwal2010geometric} for $p(X|\natp)$ is
\begin{align}
    p(\natp) &\propto \exp( - n_0 \bregman(\natp ; \natp_0) )
\end{align}
where $n_0$ and $\natp_0$ are (hyper)parameters of the prior, and $\bregman(\natp ; \natp_0)$ is introduced above.
Intuitively, $n_0$ is a number of fictive points observed from a distribution with parameter $\natp_0$.
The negative log-likelihood of the prior is
\begin{align*}
    -\log p(\natp) = n_0 (\logpart(\natp)  - \natp^\top \meanp_0 ) + \cst
\end{align*}
which is the formula for the exponential family with sufficient statistics $(\natp ,\logpart(\natp))$ and with natural parameter $(n_0 \mu_0, -n_0)$.
Then the joint log-likelihood of $\mD =(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ and $\natp$ is
\begin{multline}
    -\log p(\mD|\natp)p(\natp) 
    = (n_0+n) \logpart (\natp) \\
    - \theta^\top \left(n_0 \meanp_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n T_i \right) + \cst
    \label{eq:joint_likelihood}
\end{multline}
where $T_i=T(X_i)$.
This means the posterior given $\mD$ is part of the same family, with natural parameters $(n_0 \mu_0 + \sum_i T_i , -(n_0 + n))$.

\paragraph{Maximum A Posteriori (MAP).}
Minimizing~\eqref{eq:joint_likelihood} over $\natp$ yields the MAP estimate
\begin{align}
    \hat \natp = \argmin_\natp -\log p(\mD|\natp) + n_0 \bregman(\natp ; \natp_0) \; .
\end{align}
If they can be satisfied, the MAP verifies the first oder optimality conditions
\begin{align}
    \nabla \logpart(\hat \natp_\text{MAP}) = \hat \meanp_\text{MAP}
    = \frac{n_0 \meanp_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n T_i}{n_0+n} \; .
\end{align}
When $n_0=0$ -- eg we observed zero samples from the prior -- we recover the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)
\begin{align}
	\hat \mu_\text{MLE} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n T_i}{n}
\end{align}
These rules are known as moment matching.
The MLE and MAP estimates are statistics of the dataset $\mD$. Given a random dataset, we wish to bound their deviation from the optimum $\natp^*$ or $\meanp^*$.


\section{Open Problem}

Let $\natp^* := \argmin \expect[X\sim\cD]{-\log p(X|\natp)}$, where $\cD$ is any distribution such that $\E[T] = \meanp^* \in \cM$.
Then the suboptimality on the population log-likelihood is exactly the KL between our current model and the true distribution
\begin{multline}
    \expect[X\sim \cD]{-\log p(X|\natp) + \log p(X|\natp^*) } \\
	= \KL( p(.|\natp^*) ; p(.|\natp)) \; .
\end{multline}
Note that $\cD$ does not have to be part of the exponential family.
For the exponential family, the KL is equal to the Bregman divergence induced by the log-partition function, or alternatively by the entropy, being careful with the order of the arguments 
\begin{align}
\boxed{
	\KL( p(.|\natp^*) ; p(.|\natp))
    = \bregman (\natp ; \natp^*)
    = \bregmanconj ( \meanp^* ; \meanp)
}
\end{align}

Typical works on parameter estimation bound the deviation with norms -- e.g. bounding $\expect[p(x\cond\theta_*)]{\norm{\theta-\theta_*}^p}$ for some norm and some power. \TODO{cite} 
Or more generally, they  use distances rather than divergences as they are symmetric and usually behave smoothly. \TODO{cite} 
A contrario the KL is not smooth, and it can be infinite in misspecified settings.
But as the MLE is the minimizer of the log-likelihood, we wish to bound the sub-optimality.

Our question is: how does the KL behave when $\natp$ is the maximum-likelihood or the MAP estimate ? Can we get upper-bounds on the following quantities ?
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:bregmanMLE}
	\expect[\mD]{\bregmanconj \left (\E [T] ;  \inv{n}  \smallsum_i T_i \right )} \\
	\label{eq:bregmanMAP}
	\expect[\mD]{\bregmanconj \left (\E [T] ; \frac{n_0 \mu_0 + \smallsum_i T_i}{n_0+n} \right )} 
\end{align}
where the outer expectation is on the dataset $\mD = \{X_1, \dots, X_n \}$ sampled i.i.d from $\cD$.
More explicitly, can we write an upper bound that does not involve an expectation over the dataset -- e.g. where the stochasticity is removed.


\paragraph{Remark.}
This could be seen as a concentration inequality, expressed with a Bregman divergence instead of a norm.
A key difference though, is that the random variable $T(X)$ is connected to the metric $\logpart$. 
Indeed expressions~\eqref{eq:bregmanMLE} or~\eqref{eq:bregmanMAP} can be infinite for another choice of random variable. 
For instance, if we plug in $\conj(\mu)= -\log(\mu)$, which defines a divergence on positive numbers, and $T(X) \sim \cN(0,1)$ which can be negative.

\paragraph{Remark 2.}
The expectation of the MLE may be infinite, for instance with $\cN(0,\sigma^2)$ and $n\leq 2$. Instead of taking the expectation,  we might want to bound this quantity in high probability, without resorting to Markov inequality, but that is a difficult endeavor.

\section{Insights}

\subsection{MAP as Stochastic Mirror Descent}
\TODO{s
}


\subsection{Asymptote}
As a reference point for any finite convergence rate, it is interesting to know the asymptotic behavior of these quantities as $n \rightarrow +\infty$.
Asymptotic results typically show that natural parameters $\natp$ asymptotically normal ; reaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound \citep[for instance Ch4.2]{van2000asymptotic}.
Here the MAP is more simply expressed with mean parameters $\meanp$.
We get the asymptote by approximating the Bregman divergence using a second order Taylor expansion
\begin{align}
    \bregmanconj(\mu^* ; \mu) 
    &=\half  \norm{\mu^* - \mu}^2_{\nabla^2\conj(\mu^*)}
    + O(\norm{\mu - \mu^*}^3)
\end{align}
where the Mahalanobis norm  $\| x \|_\mM^2 = x^\top \mM x$  is induced by the hessian of the entropy -- the inverse \textit{Fisher information matrix} -- at the optimum, 
\begin{align}
    \mF^*
    :=\nabla^2\conj(\mu^*) 
    = \nabla^2\logpart(\natp^*)^{-1} 
    = \Cov_{\natp^*}[T(X)]^{-1}  \; .
\end{align}
From there, it is possible to show an asymptotic rate for the MLE and the MAP
\begin{align}
\label{eq:MAP_asymptote}
	\E \bregmanconj \left (\E [T(X)] ; \hat \meanp_n^\text{MLE/MAP} \right ) 
	= \frac{d}{2n} + O(n^{- \frac{3}{2}}) \; .
\end{align}
Both MLE and MAP have the same asymptote, as the contribution of the prior $n_0 \meanp_0$ gets negligible compared to the data for large $n$.
This asymptote is also independent of the optimum $\meanp^*$.

\subsection{Quadratic Case}
As another reference point, let us consider the case $\logpart(\natp) = \half \norm{\natp}_2^2$.
For instance, this is the log-partition of a Gaussian with variance $1$ and unknown mean ($\cX=\real, \nu(dx) = \exp(\half[-x^2])dx, T(X)=X$).
Then $\conj(\meanp) = \half \norm{\meanp}_2^2$ as well, and both Bregman divergences are squared $\ell^2$ distances
\begin{align}
	\bregmanconj(\meanp^* ; \meanp) = \half \norm{\meanp^* -  \meanp }_2^2  \; .
\end{align}
Thanks to the independence of samples we can break down the MLE into individual point's contributions
\begin{align}
	\expect{\half \norm{\m^* -  \inv{n}  \smallsum_i T_i}_2^2} 
	=\frac{\Var(T)}{2n} 
\end{align}
Adding a reference mean $\mu_0$ to get the MAP yields
\begin{align}
	\expect{\bregmanconj(\meanp^*; \MAPm)}
	&= \frac{n \Var(T) +  n_0^2 \norm{\mu^* -  \mu_0}^2}{(n+n_0)^2}
	%\\ &= O\left(\frac{\Var(T)}{n} \right) + O\left(\frac{\norm{\mu^* -  \mu_0}^2}{n^2} \right)
\end{align}
so we have a variance term in $O(n^{-1})$ and a bias term decreasing as $O(n^{-2})$. We would like to get a similar result for arbitrary exponential families.
If we make restrictive assumptions on the log-partition function, we can relate $\bregmanconj$ to a norm or a quadratic.

{\bf If $\conj$ is $L$-Lipschitz} (e.g. $\logpart$ is defined within the $\ell^2$-ball of radius $L$), then
\begin{align}
    \bregmanconj(\mu^* ; \mu) 
    &\leq L \norm{\mu^* - \mu} + \norm{\natp} \norm{\mu^* - \mu} \\
    &\leq 2L \norm{\mu^* - \mu}
\end{align}
so $\bregmanconj$ is $2L$-Lipschitz, and we get a $O(\inv{\sqrt{n}})$ rate.

{\bf If $\conj$ is $L$-smooth} (e.g. $\logpart$ is $\frac{1}{L}$-strongly convex), then
\begin{align}
    \bregmanconj(\mu^* ; \mu) 
    \leq \frac{L}{2} \norm{\mu^* - \mu}^2
\end{align}
so $\bregmanconj$ is upper bounded by a quadratic, and we get the same rate as a Gaussian.

\subsection{Locally Quadratic Case}
All Bregman divergences are locally quadratic. 
Under some assumptions, we can quantify  when this quadratic behavior  kicks in.
For instance {\bf when $\conj$ is self-concordant} \citep[Ch.4.1]{nesterov2003introductory}. 
This is true when $T$ is 1-dimensional and $\logpart$ is self-concordant 
-- e.g. exponential distribution, 
Pareto distribution with known minimum value, 
Weibull distribution with known shape k, 
Laplace distribution
with known mean
-- or when $T$ lives in a compact \citep{bubeck2015entropic}. Then the bound
\begin{align}
	 \bregmanconj(\m^*,\m) \leq \norm{\m^*-\m}_{\mF^*}^2
\end{align}
holds whenever $\norm{\m^*-\m}_{\mF^*} < 0.21$. 
Similarly, \citet{kakade2010learning} assumes a bound on all higher order moments at $\natp^*$ to quantify when $\logpart$ starts behaving quadratically, but their rate does not directly apply to $\conj$ and $\m$.

\TODO{Reference \citet{ostrovskii2021finite}.}

All these works give \textit{large sample} results -- results that hold only for $n\geq N$ for some constant $N$ -- but none of them  apply to small $n$.

\subsection{Bias-Variance Decomposition}
In both examples (add link), the upper bound takes the form $O(\inv{n}) + O(\frac{\text{bias}}{n^2})$, reminding us of the bias-variance decomposition. In fact, it is possible to write such a decomposition for any Bregman divergence
Let $\tilde \theta_n := \expect{\hat \theta_n}$ be the expectation of the MAP in primal space, and $\tilde \mu_n = \nabla \logpart(\tilde \theta_n )$ be the corresponding mean parameter.
As described by \citet[Theorem 0.1]{pfau2013generalized}, the  expected Bregman decomposes like
\begin{align}
	\expect{\bregmanconj(\mu^* ; \hat \mu_n)} 
	&= {\bregmanconj(\mu^* ; \tilde \mu_n)}
	+ {\expect{\bregmanconj(\tilde \mu_n ; \MAPm)}}
	\label{eq:primal_pivot}
\end{align}

Remark : In this decomposition, the primal expectation $\expect{\hat \theta_n}$ is taking the role of pivot / reference point. An estimator will be unbiased if its primal expectation is non-zero. 
This is not true for the MLE. In fact for the gaussian variance MLE, the bias decreases like ${\bregmanconj(\mu^* ; \tilde \mu_n)} \leq \frac{2}{n(n-2)}$.
A contrario, the MLE is unbiased wrt the dual parameter, but the decomposition there is not clean.

\paragraph{Illustrations.}
We show these decompositions for $\cN(0,\sigma^2)$ in Figure~\ref{fig:variance_decomposition} and  $\cN(\mu, \sigma^2)$ in Figure~\ref{fig:gaussian_decomposition}.
In particular for $\cN(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we illustrate the characters featured in these decompositions $\hat \mu_n^\text{MLE},\hat \mu_n^\text{MAP},\mu_n,\tilde \mu_n, \mu^*$ and $\mu_0$ (and corresponding primal parameters)  in Figure~\ref{fig:bias-variance-numerical}. \RLP{Tune figures.}

\section{Examples}


\subsection{Gaussian Variance}
A core example of this paper is a centered gaussian with unknown variance $\cN(0,\sigma^2)$. 
The density is	$p(x) = \inv{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$.
Defining $T(X)=X^2$ as the sufficient statistic, we get natural parameter $\natp = -\inv{2 \sigma^2} <0$, and mean parameter $\mu=\E[T(X)] = \sigma^2 >0$. 
Mean and natural parameters are roughly inverse of each other $\natp = -\inv{2 \mu}$.
Now we can match the log-likelihood with the exponential family template to get the log-partition function, and taking the conjugate to find the entropy
\begin{align}
	\logpart (\natp) &= - \half \log(-\natp)  + \half \log(\pi) \\
	\conj(\mu) &= \half\left( -\log(\mu) + \log\frac{\pi}{2} - 1 \right) \; .
\end{align}
Both the log-partition and  the entropy are roughly negative logarithm $z\mapsto - \log(z)$.
It means the conjugate prior is the exponential family with sufficient statistic $(\natp, \log(-\natp) )$, eg a negative Gamma distribution.
It also means $\bregman$ and $\bregmanconj$ have the same shape
\begin{align}
	\bregmanconj( \mu_*; \mu_n) 
	&= \half \left ( \frac{\mu_*}{ \mu_n} - 1 - \log  \frac{\mu_*}{ \mu_n} \right) \\
	\bregman( \natp_n; \natp_* )
	&=  \half \left ( \frac{ \natp_n}{\natp_*} - 1 - \log  \frac{ \natp_n}{\natp_*} \right) \; .
\end{align}
In other words, this divergence measures the discrepancy between the ratio $\frac{ \natp_n}{\natp_*} =  \frac{\mu_*}{ \mu_n}  $ and $1$ via the function $\phi$
\begin{align}
	\phi(z) := \half (z - 1 - \log(z))
\end{align}
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:phi}. 
Below we report upper bounds on the expected value of this divergence for the MLE and the MAP.

	}
	\label{fig:curves}
\end{figure}


\begin{theorem}[MLE Tight Bound]
	The MLE of $\cN(0,\mu_*)$ is $\hat \mu_n^\text{MLE} = \inv{n} \sum_i X_i^2 $.
	Its expected suboptimality is infinite when $n\leq 2$, and otherwise upper-bounded as
	\begin{align}
		 \expect{\bregmanconj( \mu_*; \hat \mu_n^\text{MLE}) }
			\leq \inv{2n} +\frac{2}{n(n-2)} \; .
			\label{eq:MLE_rate}
	\end{align}
\end{theorem}

This upper bound is asymptotically tight.
We illustrate its numerical behavior in Figure~\ref{fig:curves}.
We get a similar bound for the multivariate generalization :
the expected value is infinite whenever $n \leq d+1$ where $d$ is the dimension, and is otherwise bounded by $O(\frac{d^2}{n} + \frac{d^3}{n(n-d-1)} )$.
  
For the MAP, we get an upper bound thanks to the inequality $ - \log(z) \leq \inv{z} - 1$ which implies
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:log_bound} 
	\phi(z) \leq \half (z + \inv{z}) - 1 = \frac{(z-1)^2}{2 z} \; .
\end{align}

\begin{theorem}[MAP Bound]
 For $n\in \naturalnumbers$, let us  define
 \begin{align}
	b_n = \frac{(1 + \inv{n_0} - \frac{\mu_0}{\mu^*})^2}{2 (\frac{\mu_0}{\mu^*}+\frac{(n-2)_+}{n_0})(1 + \frac{n}{n_0} )} \; .
 \end{align}
The expected suboptimality of the MAP of $\cN(0,\mu^*)$ with prior hyper-parameters $(n_0,\mu_0)$ is
 \begin{equation}
	\expect{\bregmanconj( \mu_*; \hat \mu_n^\text{MAP})}
	\leq \begin{cases}
		\inv{2(n_0+1)}  +  b_1 \ \text{if}\ n=1,\\
		\frac{1}{n_0 \frac{\mu_0}{\mu^*} +n-2} + b_n \ \text{if}\ n\geq 2
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:MAP_rate}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

This inequality highlights a clear variance-bias decomposition.
In particular, there is no bias term when $\frac{\mu_0}{\mu^*} =1 + \inv{n_0} $, which happens when the prior is slightly larger than the ground truth.  For instance, when $n_0=1$, it encourages us to set $\mu_0 = 2 \mu^*$.
Remark that the variance term is not asymptotically tight as the log-inequality we used \eqref{eq:log_bound} is not quadratically tight around $1$. We are basically losing a factor 2 compared to $1/2n$.

\section{Optimization Perspective}
\fdk{Some sections are obv. too long, and some info irrelevant.}

In the context of optimization, why do we care? 

\subsection{Stochastic mirror descent}

\fdk{
- Would mirror descent and the equivalence with MLE/MAP be introduced earlier?
- Mirror descent \citep{nemirovski1983problem,beck2003mirror}
- (also called NoLips \citep{bauschke2017descent}, 
relative gradient descent \citep{hanzely2018fastest},
Bregman proximal gradient, ...)
}

{\bf In online learning, } \fdk{bounded gradient assumption}

{\bf In smooth optimization, } there has been recent advances in optimization that go beyond the Euclidean case, 
to optimize a function $f$ when it is not smooth, meaning its gradient is not $L$-Lipschitz,
neither strongly convex in the Euclidean norm, using the concept of relative smoothness 
\citep{bauschke2017descent,lu2018relatively}.
Instead of measuring strong-convexity and smoothness in the Euclidean norm (or any norm), 
the $\mu$-strong convexity and $L$-smoothness of a function $f$ 
relative to a reference function $A$ is defined 
as 
\aligns{
	\mu \cB_{A}(x, y)
	\leq 
	\cB_f(x,y)
	\leq 
	L \cB_A(x,y).
}
Those conditions ensure the linear convergence rate of mirror descent with $A$ as the reference function.
Maximum likelihood in exponential families
that fits the theory developped for mirror descent well. 
Indeed, 
\aligns{
	f(\theta) = A(\theta) - \expect[x\sim p(x\cond\theta)]{\lin{x, \theta}}
}
is $1$-smooth and $1$-strongly convex relative to $A$,
and the the optimality gap is the divergence
\aligns{
	f(\theta) - f(\theta_*) = 
	\cB_A(\theta, \theta_*)
	= \KL(p(\cdot\cond\theta_*);\, p(\cdot\cond\theta)),
}
where $\theta_* = \arg\min_\theta f(\theta)$.
But the known results for stochastic mirror descent do not give convergence rates 
for all exponential families.

{\bf Traditional results}
in stochastic optimization,
such as the work of \citet{nemirovski2009robust,ghadimi2012optimal},
rely on the assumption that the reference function $A$ 
is itself strongly convex relative to a norm $\norm{\cdot}$,
(meaning that $f$ is strongly convex). 
This apply for the MLE problem of a Gaussian distribution 
with fixed variance, 
but not when the covariance is unknown,
or for a Poisson distribution, as $-\log(\theta)$ and $\exp(\theta)$
are not strongly convex.

The work of \citet{bauschke2017descent,lu2018relatively}
has renewed interest for analyses of mirror descent in the smooth setting, 
and developping new tools to analyse problems
without relying on strong-convexity in an underlying norm.
However, they do not yet address the problem satisfactorily.

\textbf{An adaptation of the bounded variance,}
investigated by \citet{hanzely2018fastest}, 
defines the following bounded quantity.
Letting $\theta^+(v)$ be a step from $\theta$ with vector $v$, 
$\theta^+(v) = \nabla A^*(\nabla A(\theta) - v)$,
\alignn{\label{eq:assumption-hanzely}
	\expect[\tilde g]{
	\lin{
		\nabla f(\theta) - \tilde g, 
		\theta^+\!\!\paren{\eta \tilde g } - \theta^+\!\!\paren{\eta \nabla f(\theta)}
	}
	}
	\leq 
	\eta C,
}
for some step-size $\eta$ and constant $C$. Let us unpack this quantity; 

{\bf For a Gaussian} with known variance, 
with $A(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\norm{\theta}^2$, 
this definition recovers the variance of the stochastic gradient
$\expect[\tilde g_t\!\!]{\norm{\nabla f(\theta_t) - \tilde g_t}{}^2}\leq C$.
More generally, if $A$ is $\mu$-strongly convex in $\norm{\cdot}$,
the left-hand side of \cref{eq:assumption-hanzely} is bounded by 
\aligns{
	\frac{1}{\mu} \expect{\norm{\nabla f(\theta_t) - \tilde g_t}{}^2_*},
}
and a uniform bound $C$ exist if the variance of the stochastic gradient is bounded.

{\bf In divergence,} this condition states that the (symmetrized) divergence between 
a deterministic and stochastic update is bounded in expectation,
\aligns{
	&
	\mathbb{E}_{\tilde g_t}\bigg[
	\cB_{A^*}\paren{\mu - \eta g, \mu - \eta \nabla f(\theta)}
	\\
	&\hphantom{\mathbb{E}_{\tilde g}[}
	+ \cB_{A^*}\paren{\mu - \eta \nabla f(\theta), \mu - \eta g}
	\bigg]
	\leq 
	\eta C.
}

{\bf For a maximum likelihood problem, }
where $\tilde g = \mu - x$ 
where $x \sim p(x\cond\theta_*)$,
and $\nabla f(\theta) = \mu - \mu_*$,
\aligns{
	&
	\mathbb{E}_{x}\bigg[
	\cB_{A^*}\paren{(1-\eta) \mu + \eta x, (1-\eta)\mu + \eta \mu_*}
	\\
	&\hphantom{\mathbb{E}_{\tilde g_t}[}
	\cB_{A^*}\paren{(1-\eta)\mu + \eta \mu_*, (1-\eta) \mu + \eta x}
	\bigg]
	\leq 
	\eta C.
}

\section{Blurbs/ideas?}



\subsection{SGD blurb}
\fdk{
%
There is a long line work bounding the convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent.
Beyond the results of \citet{robbins1951stochastic}, 
we now have proofs on smooth, strongly convex problems and bounded variance 
(as well as other assumptions on the noise, reviewed later)
a decreasing step-size and an averaging scheme gets 
a $1/t$ convergence rate, 
which matches the asymptotic rate of unbiased estimation,
through clever averaging schemes \citep{rakhlin2012making,lacostejulien2012simpler} 
\\
Those papers assume the stochastic gradients are bounded, 
but small modifications also work for bounded variance instead.
\\
We do have extensions to other notions of bounded variance, 
for example assuming that the stochastic gradients are gradients of a perturbed smooth function $f_i$ 
and that the minimum of $f$ and the minima of the $f_i$ 
are bounded, $\expect{\min_x f(x) - \min_x f_i(x)} \leq \sigma^2$,
or that the gradient noise is bounded only at the minimum. 
For a review, see \citet{gower2019sgd}.
\\
However, for some problems, combining decreasing step-sizes and averaging is not necessary,
even when the function is not strongly convex.
This is the case for maximum likelihood estimation and matches the asymptotic rates, 
but holds more generally, for example for linear and logistic regressions \citep{bach2013nonstronglyconvex,moulines2011non}.
}


\subsection{Poisson likelihood?}
\fdk{
\citet{bauschke2017descent} and \citet{hanzely2018fastest} both use the example of Poisson inverse problems/Poisson regression
as examples. 
The simpler case of the MLE of a Poisson distribution is also unsolved, though. 
In this case, $h(x) = 1/x!$, $x \in \mathbb{N}$, $A(\theta) = e^\theta$ over $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$,
$A^*(\mu) = \mu \log \mu - \mu$ over $\mu \in \mathbb{R}_+$.
It is neither strongly-convex nor self-concordant (at least according to the standard definition, 
although it satisfies generalized notions of self-concordance as $A'''(\theta) = A''(\theta)$).
}

\subsection{``simple'' open problem?}
\fdk{
A ``simple open problem'';
assume we have a deterministic problem, so that we know where the minimum is. 
Can we figure out a (deterministic) path from $\theta_0$ to $\theta_*$ 
that has optimality decreasing as $1/n^2$, 
to mirror the bias term of gradient descent?
}

\subsection{Connection with acceleration?}
\fdk{
The problems on how to deal with Bregman divergences abound in optimization, beyond stochasticity. 
For example, we haven't yet figured out the analog of Nesterov-type acceleration 
on relatively smooth and strongly convex problems, 
to bring the convergence rate from linear in $(1-\kappa)$ to $(1-\sqrt{\kappa})$, 
or just from $1/T$ to $1/T^2$ in the (non-strongly) convex case.
\citet{dragomir2021optimal}  shows that naïve application of Bregman updates can not achieve acceleration.
The tools developed to make progress on one problem might help make progress on the other.
